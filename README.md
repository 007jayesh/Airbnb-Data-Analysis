# **Project Summary**
Airbnb is an American company that operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. The company is based in San Francisco, California, the platform is accessible via the website and mobile app. Airbnb's mission is to create a world where anyone can belong anywhere and the company focused on creating an end-to-end travel platform to handle every part of a consumer‚Äôs trip.
This dataset contains approx 48895 observations with 16 columns and it is a mix of categorical and numeric values. Categorical variables in data are name, host_name, neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, room type, and last review. Numerical columns are id, host_id, latitude, longitude, price and availability_365. 
First, we cleaned the data through Dropping Unnecessary columns for data simplification, handled missing values and replaced the null values with zero.

# **Questions solved**
1. What can we learn about different hosts and areas?
  * Top 10 most listed Hosts
  * Count of Room type based on Neighbourhood Group
  * The proportion of Hosts listed in all neighbourhood groups based on Host_Id.
2. What can we learn from predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc.)
  * Which Neighbourhood group is the most costly
  * Show the top neighbourhoods that have the highest number of properties
  * Neighbourhood group with the most no of reviews recorded.
3. Which Hosts are the busiest and why?
4. How can analysis of this data help in listing new business and setting a price for future property growth?
5. Is there any noticeable difference in traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it?
6. Price Distribution concerning neighbourhood groups and why does Manhattan have a high average price?
7. Price band, Maximum and Minimum values of each Neighbourhood group.
8. Which are the most popular and most occupied room types on basis of their availability?
